This is successful attempt to make decompressor and decryptor for MDSv2 / MDX files.

It's not full converter to MDSv1 or ISO, it's just attempt to make "base" for other developers who want support this formats.

Initially I try reverse structures, ciphers and etc, but after some time I realized that is encryption is based on TrueCrypt, 
and seems it's was old version where still no XTS encryption mode but they just update their lib and add XTS(with some errors).

So I took TrueCrypt 5.1a sources and adapt it, so it's work same, but seems DT use only AES256 with GF.
It's can be simplify to use only one cipher, but needs more tests with various MDSv2/MDX images.

In `RE_firsttry` my first attempt to write decryptor where I realize it's modified TrueCrypt.
So I just rewrite it with parts of TrueCrypt in `src` dir.


To build `reader` in `src` dir prepared simple Makefile, so you can just do `make` in dir and it will build `mds` binary.


Usage is `mds /path/to/file.mds [password]`



In `testdata` I make test files with different modes. Password is in the filenames (pass and pazz)
